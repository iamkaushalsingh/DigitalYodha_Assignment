Start a Local Server:

Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
Navigate to the directory where the assignment files are located using the cd command.
Once you're in the correct directory, start a local server using Python's built-in HTTP server. Run the following command:

[python -m http.server]


This command will start a local server on port 8000 by default, and it will serve files from the current directory.
Access Your Website:

Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
In the address bar, type http://localhost:8000 and press Enter.

Stopping the Local Server:

To stop the local server, return to your command prompt or terminal window.
Press Ctrl + C to stop the server process.
